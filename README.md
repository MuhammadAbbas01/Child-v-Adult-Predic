# Child vs. Adult Mortality Classification Model
# Overview
This project develops a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify mortality predictions between children and adults based on health and socio-economic factors. The model leverages advanced image processing and data analysis techniques to identify patterns that correlate with mortality risk.

# Project Structure
Data Collection: Gathered a dataset containing images and relevant socio-economic indicators for both child and adult populations.
Data Preprocessing: Steps for cleaning, normalizing, and augmenting the data to enhance model performance.
# Model Architecture:
Designed a CNN architecture suitable for classification tasks.
Implemented various layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers for feature extraction and classification.
# Model Training:
Trained the model using appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
Used validation techniques to monitor performance during training.
Evaluation: Assessed the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
# Key Insights
The model provides critical insights into the distinguishing factors between child and adult mortality, informing healthcare strategies and resource allocation.

# Next Steps
Fine-tune the model parameters to improve accuracy.
Experiment with transfer learning using pre-trained models.
Explore additional datasets to enhance the model's robustness and generalizability.
# Requirements
Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
